# AKS desktop

AKS desktop delivers an application focused experience for deploying and managing workloads on Azure Kubernetes Service.

Built on top of open-source [Headlamp](https://headlamp.dev), AKS desktop provides a guided, self-service UX built on supported AKS features and best practices. Designed to work within your existing environment and tools, it enables team collaboration through RBAC while abstracting complexity without removing control.

To learn how to get started with AKS desktop, create projects, deploy applications, and explore the full set of features, check out the [official AKS desktop documentation](https://aka.ms/aks/aks-desktop).

## Installation

Please download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/Azure/aks-desktop/releases/latest) page.

## Development

Install Node.js 22.22.2 or newer. npm 10 and newer are supported; the repository
uses npm 12.0.1 in CI and for lockfile maintenance.

```bash
npm install --global npm@12.0.1
npm --version
```

Using the pinned version avoids unrelated lockfile changes when updating
dependencies.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To build the application after installing dependencies:

```bash
npm run build
```

The default build targets the host architecture. Release targets can also be
built explicitly with `npm run build:linux:arm64`, `npm run build:mac:arm64`,
or `npm run build:win:arm64` on the corresponding host platform.

### Build output

The AKS tool setup stages `build/aks-tool-environment.cjs` beside the bundled CLI.
The product manifest selects it as the command-environment callback, so AKS verifies
its tool paths and digests and places them ahead of login-shell installations.
This policy is AKS-owned; Headlamp only invokes the configured app-owned callback.

After a successful build, the command prints the absolute output directory.
Installers, archives, and unpacked applications are written under the installed
Headlamp package, **not** a `dist/` directory at the repository root:

```text
node_modules/@headlamp-k8s/headlamp-source/source/app/dist/
```

| Platform | Packages in that directory | Unpacked application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | `.dmg` | `mac-arm64/AKS desktop.app` or `mac/AKS desktop.app` for x64 |
| Windows | `.exe` installer | `win-unpacked/AKS desktop.exe` for x64 or `win-arm64-unpacked/AKS desktop.exe` |
| Linux | `.AppImage`, `.tar.gz`, and `.deb` for x64 | `linux-unpacked/aks-desktop` for x64 or `linux-arm64-unpacked/aks-desktop` |

The files at the top level are the distributable packages; the platform
subdirectories contain unpacked builds used by `npm run test:distribution`.
The directory can contain output from earlier builds. Copy packages elsewhere
before cleaning or reinstalling dependencies, which can replace this generated
source package. See [distribution validation](MAINTENANCE.md#validate-a-distribution)
for the verification commands.
